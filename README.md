# LogicCircuitSimulator

Project is unfinished, deprecated. Its spiritual successor is ECAT.

Repository cloned from Team Foundation Version Control.
I couldn't get the GitHub to migrate it (which would keep history), so, considering I won't be developing it further, I just
copied the final version.
